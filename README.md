# 🍞 Bakery Management System (S.N Bakers)

This repository contains a **Bakery Management System** project for **BCS Semester 1 – Programming Fundamentals**.  
It’s a group project written in C++, where we built a **menu-driven system** to manage inventory, employees, sales, discounts, and customer feedback.

The project demonstrates fundamental **C++ programming concepts** such as **structures, arrays, loops, functions, and file handling**, while simulating a real-world bakery scenario.
